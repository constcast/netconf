How to build vermontconfig:

Make sure you have ant and java (1.5) installed and in your path. Change into
the base directory and type

$ ant

That should trigger the build process. Please drop a message to 
vermont-dev@berlios.de, if you encounter any build problems.

How to run vermontconfig:

You can either run vermontconfig by hand or run it by script.

1.) java -jar NetconfConnect.jar hostname portnumber username password role /path/to/configfile

or

2.) vermontConfig.sh /path/to/configfile

You might need to adopt the vermontConfig.sh script (correct hostname, port,
etc).

Please send a message to vermont-dev@berlios.de, if you have any problems with
the software.
